Pokemon style turn based combat game

The purpose for this project is to reacreate the combact from the pokemon games in my own way greating a game based off that combat.

My goal is to have the majority of the code finished and have my own unique "pokemon" made for the game by june so all Ill need to do is finish up whatever code is undone and then work on the reflection video and paper.

Im hoping to use pygame for my project because I only know how to code in python so a program used to code games in python would be best for me.
